# simple CBIR implementation via C #
**This project is a demonstration of CBIR using simple algorithm and basic math functions.**
This project aims to provide proof of concept on that even the simplest code with C can provide similar effects in libraries like OpenCV and tools like Matlab.

With this project, image features, FFT, segmentation, dynamic threshold, CCH, FCTH, and many more other image related operations can be achieved.
